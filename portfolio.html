        <h3>In freshman year, I joined the Google internship with little to no coding experience apart from a python class from middle school. I worked on two main projects during the internship: an informational site for a show & a time management site for independent work. My bigger focus during my time at Google was to develop my understanding of coding concepts through a Code Academy course. This internship fostered my interest in Computer Science and lead me to exploring more opportunities in this field.</h3>
